We view this course as a cooperative learning experience and expect students to engage the topics through hands-on assignments, readings, and thoughtful discussions in the classroom. Class preparation is essential for case based sessions. Assignments provide an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with some of the tools and technologies covered in this course. They include (a) working with a Microsoft Access database (b) writing a twenty-line simple program for a very simple computer designed specifically for this assignment (c) a two-page web description of an IT application used in manufacturing (d) an agenda to help you keep up with IT and (e) a take-home final exam. All assignments are to be received before class on the due date.
